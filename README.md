# Polymer Dashboard using Material Design

This project is a Polymer Dashboard with Material Design and consists of the following parts:

![alt tag](http://bstavroulakis.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/materialAdmin.jpg)

- A Login and Register Page
- A Homepage with various blocks
- A Tasks page
- A Mails page
- Some real-time functionality so if you open the site in two tabs and update a task or mail it will automatically load on the other tab as well.
- The project is using a front-end database (IndexedDb or WebSQL depending the system). But it can easily use a back-end RESTful service as well since each call passes through the repo files => https://github.com/bstavroulakis/polymer-dashboard/tree/master/elements/ma-repos. So you can plugin any back-end you wish in the future instead of using the front-end database/logic.
- Testing (under construction)

I would love some feedback/fixes/considerations on the approach and who knows it may grow in the future if it gains the right momentum.
